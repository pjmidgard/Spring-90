Algorithm: Division plus 1 this and write a bit less or more and multiply by this number back and minus. Repeat this many times. The number must be two n like this 2 ** n. E.g.: 32 bits n=32 2 ** (n+2) and plus the same bits of long of the times: times (2**32)-1. 1-65535 bits. Deep: X + 9 bits.

E.g.:

Deep: 32

7+25=32 bits.
